🎧 Mood Detection Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to detect moods or emotions from audio or other data modalities. It includes all necessary preprocessing, training, evaluation, and memory profiling steps to monitor model performance.

📁 Dataset
Please download the dataset from the linkk provided above.

Please unzip it before running the notebook.

Ensure the dataset path is correctly referenced in the notebook after extraction.

🧠 Features
Mood/Emotion classification using deep learning (Keras/TensorFlow).

Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report.

Memory usage profiling during training.

Code compatible with Google Colab.

📒 Contents
Mood_Detection.ipynb: Main notebook with training pipeline and model evaluation.

dataset.zip: Zipped dataset required for training/testing (must be extracted).

🛠️ Setup
Make sure to install the required packages directly in google colab:
!pip install memory_profiler

🚀 Usage
Mount Google Drive (if using Colab).
